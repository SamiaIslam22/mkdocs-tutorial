## New York University
## MS & PhD in Biology

NYU Biology’s Ph.D. program offers training in a broad range of biological research fields, including developmental genetics, genomics and systems biology, molecular and cellular biology, evolutionary biology, and infectious disease. Our dynamic and diverse community of faculty and graduate students engages closely on all aspects of scientific investigation. Strong mentoring relationships throughout the Ph.D. program develop students’ abilities to independently design and perform research, write grant proposals, and communicate their findings effectively to a wide audience. The combination of cutting edge research, world-class faculty, and a dedication to mentoring and career-building skills for our Ph.D. students defines the Ph.D. program at NYU Biology.
​
NYU Biology offers an integrated environment where students pursue cutting edge research with a world-class faculty. The department is home to a wealth of scientific expertise, state-of-the-art labs, and core facilities, the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, and the Center for Developmental Genetics. We are located in Greenwich Village, the best neighborhood in the world's most influential city. Our students are encouraged, in addition to their academic science training, to take advantage of all that NYC has to offer, including interacting with the legal, entertainment, pharma, world-health, and tech industries, as well as unique Global Opportunities for study at NYU’s Portal Campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.

## Columbia University
## MS & PhD Biology

The research interests of the Department span a number of fields that are central to modern biology: [cell & molecular](http://biology.columbia.edu/researchareas/cell-molecular-biology), [computational](http://biology.columbia.edu/researchareas/computational-biology), [developmental](http://biology.columbia.edu/researchareas/developmental-biology), [structural biology & molecular biophysics](http://biology.columbia.edu/researchareas/structure-biophysics), [genetics & genomics](http://biology.columbia.edu/researchareas/genetics-genomics), [evolutionary biology](http://biology.columbia.edu/researchareas/evolutionary-biology), [chemical biology](http://biology.columbia.edu/researchareas/chemical-biology), [microbiology,](http://biology.columbia.edu/researchareas/microbiology) and [neurobiology](http://biology.columbia.edu/researchareas/neurobiology). As a student here you will have the opportunity to receive broadly based training in these areas and to develop research expertise through laboratory rotations and your thesis research. The intimate scale of the Department assures you of close contacts with the faculty and your fellow students while the location of the Department within the wide research community of New York City ensures the maximum possible exposure to exciting scientific developments. We have a steady flow of visitors from the US and abroad who enrich our offerings through seminars, discussions and informal meetings with research groups and faculty.
​
The Department occupies a modern research facility on the Morningside Heights campus of Columbia University, a comfortable University neighborhood. [The equipment available to you](http://biology.columbia.edu/pages/resources) is state of the art, ranging from oligonucleotide synthesizers to electron microscopes. [Core facilities ](http://biology.columbia.edu/pages/resources)for protein biochemistry, cell sorting, transgenic mice and X-ray crystallography are available. A well-equipped [computer facility](http://biology.columbia.edu/pages/resources) is located within the Fairchild Building adjacent to the research laboratories. The new [Science and Engineering Library](http://library.columbia.edu/locations/science-library.html) the home to the [Digital Science Center](http://library.columbia.edu/locations/dsc.html) is located nearby in the new Northwest Corner Building.
