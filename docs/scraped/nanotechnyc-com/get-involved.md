## Nanotech NYC Outreach Program

Outreach can make all the difference for young people who come from underserved communities and do not have the resources that others have readily available to them. The Nanotech NYC Outreach Program was envisioned to create a network of Outreach Ambassadors, allowing individuals interested in using their STEM expertise to give back to at-need communities and help young students through their academic journey.
Nanotech NYC partners with local schools, outreach organizations and institutions to develop and facilitate diverse outreach programs. Our community covers all levels of education, from elementary/middle school students to Ph.D. students. Activities range from participation in outreach events, classroom demos, to coursework assistance, to professional and academic guidance and mentorship.
If you are a motivated, reliable individual who wants to inspire the next generation of scientists while giving back to the community and developing leadership skills, then you are the right Ambassador for us! Depending on your educational level, interests, and availability, Nanotech NYC will match you case-by-case with an upcoming outreach activity. We can offer outreach opportunities that accommodate all types of expertise and busy schedules.
