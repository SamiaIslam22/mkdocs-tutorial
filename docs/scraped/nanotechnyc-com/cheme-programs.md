## City College of New York
## PhD Chemical 
## Engineering
## ​

At the Grove School of Engineering, outstanding chemical engineering faculty conduct funded research in nine different areas, ranging from the design of nanostructured self-assembling proteins to the development of clean fuels, and City College students have the chance to work in these labs. City’s chemical engineering students pursue Bachelor of Engineering, Masters of Science, and Ph.D. degrees in Chemical Engineering, in order to prepare for careers in research and development, product discovery and development, plant design and operation and sales and customer support, as well as management. Our graduates also go on to medicine, biomedical engineering, law, government, and environmental protection.

## New York University
## PhD Chemical Engineering

How can we make more efficient solar cells? Will we have effective antidotes in the event of chemical warfare? Can a protein be engineered in order to better fight cancer? Is it possible to manufacture synthetic fabric without fossil fuels? Researchers in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering are exploring all that and more. If you are interested in working at the molecular level to address issues at the global level, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering might be the course of study for you.
The Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering program at the School of Engineering prepares you to fulfill that role. Our curriculum offers an advanced course of study to refine your research skills, and we teach you the problem-solving skills to surmount any problem along the way. Our Ph.D. program in Chemical Engineering is designed to outfit you with expert knowledge of the field’s core fundamentals as well as the latest research in its subtopics. By doing so, we further your specialization beyond a master’s degree, helping you achieve superior competence in a minor topic within chemical engineering.

## Stevens Institute of Technology
## PhD Chemical Engineering

Chemical engineers design, operate and improve a wide range of chemical processes that are vital to our society. Graduates of the Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science (CEMS) are equipped with a broad foundation from which to launch careers not only in the traditional petrochemical industry, specialty chemicals industry, and environmental engineering, but also in such high-tech areas as biochemical and biomedical engineering, electronic and semi-conductor processing, ceramics, plastics and other high-performance materials and electrochemical processing.
​
Materials science impacts nearly all industrial activities and has been a key enabler of the technological advances that have shaped the modern world. Students of this dynamic discipline learn new materials development from molecular and nanoscale design to highly controlled synthesis and assembly, to incorporation of their functionality into components, devices, or systems. Courses in the Stevens program also address sustainability issues related to our finite materials resources and the impact of materials utilization and disposal on the environment.
