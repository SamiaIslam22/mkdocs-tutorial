## CUNY Graduate Center
## PhD Physics

The Graduate Center at the City University of New York (CUNY), located in the heart of midtown Manhattan, is a central part of this active community, represented by faculty from various colleges across the University. As a doctoral student in our Ph.D. Program in Physics you will begin your scientific career in this inspiring environment.
The CUNY Ph.D. Program is a consortium program, comprised of eight member colleges, which boast several renowned theoretical research departments and world-class experimental facilities. With over [100 research-active faculty ](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Physics/Faculty)working in almost [all fields of physics](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Physics/Research-Areas), it is one of the largest physics graduate programs in the United States.
​
Students have access to the Advanced Science Research Center ([ASRC](http://www.asrc.cuny.edu/)), part of the CUNY Graduate Center, housing some of the most advanced experimental and fabrication research facilities in the region.

## New York University
## MS & PhD in Physics

The Department of Physics offers courses leading to the degrees of Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy. There are opportunities for study and research in both experimental and theoretical physics. Areas of specialization include astrophysics and cosmology, atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter physics, elementary particle physics, quantum field theory and string theory, quantum optics, and statistical physics. Through ongoing faculty recruitment efforts, the department continues to develop existing active research efforts and expand into new areas. 
​
Currently, the Department is located in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. There are 36 tenure and tenure-track professors in the department, two clinical faculty members, a few dozen research scientists, and postdoctoral fellows, and over 80 graduate and 90 undergraduate students. The majority of the faculty are engaged in cutting-edge research in astrophysics and cosmology, particle and astroparticle experimental and theoretical physics, hard and soft condensed matter physics, biophysics, fluid dynamics, and applied mathematical physics.

## Columbia University
## MS & PhD Physics

The Physics Department is located in Pupin Hall on Columbia University's Morningside Heights Campus in New York City. The department has about 35 faculty who teach and carry out research in the fields of astrophysics, condensed matter physics, high energy nuclear physics, high energy particle physics, and atomic, molecular, and optical physics. We have about 20 undergraduate physics majors and 100 graduate students in the department per year. The department's research is carried out on-campus in the Pupin Laboratories, Schapiro Hall, at the nearby Nevis Laboratories, and at many off-campus laboratories and sites. The richness of educational opportunities offered at the department is based upon a long and distinguished tradition of teaching and research. Columbia graduates, along with many scientists who spent their formative years here, have gone on to make extraordinary contributions to science as researchers, teachers, and intellectual leaders.
​
​There are about 100 graduate students in the Physics Department carrying out research in a large number of areas with faculty advisers both inside and outside the department. Our graduates go on to jobs in many areas of physics and outside the field of physics.

## Stevens Institute of Technology
## MS & PhD in Physics

The Master of Engineering (M. Eng.) degree is offered in physics with a choice concentration in one of three exciting areas of technology: applied optics, solid-state physics, and nanotechnology (as part of the Nanotechnology Graduate Program).
The [Master of Science](https://www.stevens.edu/schaefer-school-engineering-science/departments/physics/graduate-programs/master-science-physics) and [Doctor of Philosophy](https://www.stevens.edu/schaefer-school-engineering-science/departments/physics/graduate-programs/physics-doctoral-program) degrees are offered in physics that provides students with advanced academic training and the skills and resources to engage in high-level independent research.
The department also offers two unique interdisciplinary degree options in collaboration with other departments at Stevens. The [interdisciplinary master's program in microelectronics and photonics](https://www.stevens.edu/schaefer-school-engineering-science/departments/physics/graduate-programs/microelectronics-and-photonics-interdisciplinary-masters-program) prepares students with broad coverage of fundamentals as well as state-of-the-art industrial practices in the areas of design, fabrication, integration, and application of microelectronic and photonic devices in communication and information systems. The [interdisciplinary doctoral program](https://www.stevens.edu/schaefer-school-engineering-science/departments/physics/graduate-programs/interdisciplinary-doctoral-program) takes advantage of the complementary educational offerings and research opportunities in multiple departments, addressing the increasingly cross-cutting nature of physical science research.
