## New York University
## PhD Mechanical 
## Engineering

Mechanical engineers create the physical systems and devices that define modern society — everything from automobiles to air conditioning, robotic parts to power plants, people movers to artificial limbs, and rocket engines to satellites. At the School of Engineering, we groom our students to become the inventors and innovators of tomorrow. Our Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering program offers a balanced curriculum that emphasizes the principles behind these designs and approaches. To apply these principles in the field, we make computational and research experience an integral component of your studies. 
We also offer you the freedom to choose from 5 distinct areas of specialization: aerospace engineering, controls, and dynamic systems, fluid dynamics and thermal systems, materials engineering, mechanics and structural systems The high faculty-to-student ratio of our program ensures you develop close ties to your instructors and fellow students. This fosters lifelong relationships and a rigorous intellectual community of scholars. Many of our graduates enter such fields as computer engineering, nanotechnology, software development, and financial engineering.

## Columbia University
## PhD Mechanical 
## Engineering

The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers advanced instruction and research opportunities in a variety of areas of current interest in mechanical engineering. We offer a full range of degree programs, from an undergraduate program leading to the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree, to graduate programs leading to the Master of Science (M.S.), Doctor of Engineering Science (Eng.Sc.D.), and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees.
​
The department is home to such diverse research activities as biomechanics, mechanics of materials, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, control and robotics, manufacturing, energy systems, MEMS, and nanotechnology
​
In addition to [undergraduate programs](http://me.columbia.edu/undergraduate-program-3) in mechanical engineering, the Department of Mechanical Engineering offers graduate programs leading to the degree of [Master of Science (MS)](http://me.columbia.edu/masters-program-1) and [Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)](http://me.columbia.edu/doctoral-program-0). These programs are flexible, with a choice from among many concentrations, and with a sufficient number of elective courses to allow each student to concentrate in his or her area of interest. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required for admission to the department.
