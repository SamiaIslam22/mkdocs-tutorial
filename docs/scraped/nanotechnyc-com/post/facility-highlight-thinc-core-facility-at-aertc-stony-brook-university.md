**Can you describe what ThINC (Thermomechanical and Imaging Nanoscale Characterization) is and how it came to be?**
ThINC is a core facility at the AERTC which provides sample preparation, thermo-mechanical characterization and multiscale imaging services for innovation and research in pharmaceuticals, materials design & manufacturing, medical devices, nanotechnology, agricultural technology and life sciences. ThINC is committed to providing holistic solutions to materials and nanoscience problems by providing access to world-class instrumentation, expert personnel and expanding our services based on user needs by establishing partnerships between Stony Brook University and government, university and/or industrial laboratories. ThINC was conceptualized and established in 2012 and was an integral part of the AERTC's mission of offering collaborative R&D services to industry, start-ups and academia alike. It took about 2 years to fully install major instruments and the official grand opening was held in 2014. Since its inception, ThINC has been continually growing its instrumentation capabilities as well as the scientific expertise by professional development of facility personnel to ensure the best user experience and service can be provided.
**What are the facilities that fall under the ThINC umbrella?**
ThINC is a comprehensive core facility consisting of tools for (a) multiscale imaging and characterization microscopy, such as transmission electron microscope (TEM), focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), and confocal microscope, (b) thermal-mechanical suite, including thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and thermal conductivity meter, and (c) sample preparation station providing a robust set of equipment for needed samples of (cryogenic) microscopy imaging and characterization. ThINC provides its users access to these state-of-the-art instruments for advancing their research in drug discovery, nanotechnology, life sciences and materials design through chemical, crystallographic, mechanical, morphological, optical, and thermal characterization. More recently, we have been building a collaborative network with other facilities both at SBU and outside to provide our users access to instruments we currently do not have at ThINC.
![ThINC offers a suite of facilities including sample preparation, materials synthesis, imaging and chemical characterization facilities.](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a13670_66bdd7caabf0438f9596ed87d6e071c7~/v1/fill/w_49,h_28,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/a13670_66bdd7caabf0438f9596ed87d6e071c7~)
ThINC offers a suite of facilities including sample preparation, materials synthesis, imaging and chemical characterization facilities.
**Can you give us an idea of who the users of the facilities typically are?**
Since we are a comprehensive core facility, our users are diverse in terms of sector focus as well as organizational origins. Our users come from start-ups, industry, research labs, as well as universities and, are from a very broad range of fields, including but not limited to pharmaceuticals, engineering, chemistry, physical and life sciences and agricultural technology. In the fiscal year 2019-2020, we have served over 100 researchers from different groups. About 80% of users are from Stony Brook University, Stony Brook Medicine and Stony Brook Dental School. About 20% of users are from local industries, mostly are startup companies. While ThINC kept its doors closed during the early days of the pandemic, we were able to reopen while following all safety measures for the protection of our users and staff, and have been advancing our mission to provide guidance and research opportunities to new and existing users. 
**Who maintains the facilities?**
ThINC team includes me and Dr. Yuan Xue interfacing directly with our users and focusing on data acquisition, analysis, and consulting as well as Dr. Shruti Sharma, Program Manager, focusing on user relations and ThINC's business development. I am primarily responsible for the smooth, safe, and sustainable operations of the instrumentations as well as providing adequate user training when requested. Dr. Yuan Xue, our experienced scientist, also supports the maintenance of facilities including safety, gas supplies and general supplies. Additionally, we also have service contracts for major advanced instruments maintenance to maximize operational time and minimize instrument downtime if a situation arises. As mentioned, if desired, ThINC is equipped to train users who wish to engage in long term research activities, allowing them to utilize the facilities independently once trained and authorized.
