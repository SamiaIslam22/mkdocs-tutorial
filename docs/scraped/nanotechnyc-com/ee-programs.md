## City College of New York
## PhD Electrical Engineering

Areas of study include communications; computer networks engineering; photonics engineering, including optical communications, nonlinear optics, remote sensing and LIDAR for atmospheric and environmental studies; atmospheric solid-state lasers; optical engineering; parallel processing; VLSI design; robotics and control, control system engineering; image and signal processing; nano/micro devices; and multidimensional filter design.
​
Doctoral education in Engineering began in 1963 at the Grove School of Engineering (GSOE) of the City College of New York (CCNY / CUNY City College) under the auspices of the Graduate School and University Center of the City College of New York (CUNY Graduate Center). In August 2008, New York State's Department of Education granted authority to the City College of New York (CUNY City College) to directly offer [Ph.D. degrees in Engineering](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/engineering/phd). As the flagship science and engineering campus of the City University of New York, the City College is known for its distinguished faculty, outstanding students and graduates -- nine of twelve [CUNY Nobel Laureates](http://www.cuny.edu/about/people/alumni/nobel-laureates.html) who graduated from the City College. The Grove School of Engineering is the only engineering school in the CUNY system.

## New York University
## PhD Electrical Engineering

A century ago, the radio offered mass entertainment; 50 years later, television replaced it. Today we watch movies on handheld devices. Each evolutionary step was made possible by advances in electrical engineering. The Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering program is filled with students and faculty keenly aware of this cycle of progress. They prize the School of Engineering's emphasis on invention, innovation, and entrepreneurship — what we call i2e — and they maintain that emphasis through top-flight laboratories and a fierce dedication to advanced research.
​
​Paving the way for fifth-generation (5G) cellular communication, developing powerful and sophisticated medical diagnostic tools, improving the trustworthiness of microchips to keep computer hardware safe from cyber-attackers, exploring the outer limits of nanoelectronics — NYU researchers are doing all that and more.
​
Your studies with us will prepare you for a research career in electrical engineering after graduation. But you’ll also be capable of sharing these lessons with your own students, should you choose to teach at the university level.

## Columbia University
## PhD Electrical Engineering

The Electrical Engineering department is among the oldest in the United States and has a storied history including being at the foundation of modern radio communications, control engineering, and multimedia coding. And, every day we are hard at work at pushing new frontiers in Electrical Engineering with innovative teaching and state-of-the-art research.
​
​Research areas include: Signals, Information and Data, Systems Biology and Neuroengineering, Networking and Communications, Integrated Circuits and Systems, Nanoscale Structures and Integrated Devices, Smart Electric Energy
​
The Doctoral program is the opportunity to work closely with one of our world-renowned faculty on pushing forward the frontier of knowledge in EE and is the introduction to a career of advanced research in either an academic or industrial setting. Our Ph.D. students are a small and highly selective group who will go on to be the leaders and innovators of tomorrow's Electrical Engineering field.
