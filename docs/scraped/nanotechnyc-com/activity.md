## July Virtual Nanotech NYC Nanonite

Our July Virtual Nanonite brought together our most geographically diverse group to date, with attendees signing in from Canada, Iran, Ecuador, and all parts of the US!
We took time for everyone who is working in the nanotechnology space to talk to us about their own work, spurring interesting discussions on various applications. The cross-section of attendees' backgrounds was equally diverse, with graduate students, postdocs, working scientists and engineers, and even high schoolers in attendance. Looking forward to next month's event!

## Nanonite Networking Social - May 2020 (VIRTUAL)

Our second Virtual Nanonite is in the books, as our May Meetup brought even more attendees from outside of the New York City region, including our first international attendee! Dr. Trevino kicked things off by presenting a few slides and facilitated open discussions on how nanotechnology is being used to combat COVID-19, as well as a discussion on considerations and concerns on reopening universities and labs as the pandemic enters phase two. Thank you to all that attended!

## Nanotech NYC Holiday Party

Our inaugural Nanotech NYC Holiday Party was a smashing success! A large group of newcomers attended the event, which made for great networking opportunities for all. A special thank you to Scott Calingasan (DJ Spectrill) for DJing the event, the CUNY Materials Research Society (MRS) student chapter for co-hosting and the CUNY Graduate Center for providing the space! It was a great way to end a very productive and fun in 2019. Looking forward to even bigger things in 2020!

## Nanonite Networking Social - November 2019

Our November Nanonite Social was held on Fri, November 8, 2019, @ the Stout Flagship near Penn Station. We had a great time motivating each other to tackle the always busy holiday season and end of the year blitz. The Stout NYC Flagship location was a big hit, with nice comfy leather couches and dartboards. Thank to the new folks who came in from NJ, specifically the people from Merck and GenScript.

## National Nanotechnology Day Celebration!

On a very special day, we gathered to celebrate National Nanotechnology Day (10^9, 2019) as part of our monthly Nanonite social. This time we gathered at a The Maze in K-Town, a new location for us. The private space provided was very cozy as we had another great event full of people making new connections!

## Nanochats: MindfulTech: How to find fulfillment and build tech for a better world

Together with her team of scientists and facilitators, Kendra Krueger explored how research, science, and design can be a practice of personal liberation and transformation. Through playful games and insightful discussions, she examined the deeper philosophies of the scientific method. She helped the audience discover which tools and patterns we can emphasis as means of inspiration (in our personal and work lives) and which may be out-date ideas from an era that doesn't resemble the diverse and creative world of today.

The Nanonite crew made a glorious return to Clinton Hall East for the second time. We had some new timers coming in from Rutgers University and Yeshiva University. Welcome to the group! The food as always was delicious and people showed off their Jenga skills in friendly, but intense matches. Thank you for all that made the event!

## Nanochats: Nanotechnology and Its Role in Society

Dr. Trevino gave an introduction to fields of nanotechnology and nanoscience, describing the wide range of disciplines and technologies it encompasses to our biggest crowd to date! He highlights several application spaces where nanotechnology is currently used, including medical, military, computing, food, fashion and industrial and consumer applications, and gave perspectives on future applications. The presentation was accessible to all in attendance. The attendees were as diverse as could be and the event was a hit! A special thank you to our sponsors [New Lab](https://newlab.com/) for hosting the event and [Witec](https://www.witec.de/) for sponsoring the food and drinks!

## Nanonite Social - August 2019 Nanotech NYC Social

The Nanonite train came to Harlem for the first time since pre-Nanotech NYC days when Nanonites were spontaneously formed by nanotech enthusiasts at the CUNY Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC). The old stomping grounds did not disappoint, with a very strong contingent of researchers from Columbia University and CUNY attending. We will certainly be back to the Harlem Tavern for another fun night of networking and socializing!

## Nanotech NYC at the 2019 March for Science

On May 4th, Nanotech NYC partnered with the NYC March for Science, participating in the March and post-event activities. Nanotech NYC was present with a booth, demonstrating concepts and examples of nanotechnology in everyday life, interacting with kids, students and families. The NYC March for Science stands for the open-access of scientific information to the general public, the use of science for the common good and in the preservation of an informed democracy and the protection of human and environmental rights. Nanotech NYC stands side by side with the March for Science on these beliefs and will continue to promote and protect them at every opportunity.

## Nanochats: Organic solar cells: why, how and where?

Dr. Jason Alexander Röhr is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. He gave a detailed introduction to why we should be interested in organic solar cells, how they function and where we could potentially put this unique technology to good use. Several lively discussions broke out, as those attending had several questions for Jason regarding both solar energy and renewables in general. The event took place at the CUNY Graduate Center and was a collaborative event co-sponsored with the CUNY Materials Research Society Chapter.

## Nanonite Social - January 2019 Nanotech NYC Social

We kicked off 2019 with our new Nanonite Social Series, held at Clinton Hall in Midtown East. We entirely blown away by the wonderful turnout. The event drew students, startups, industry, and individuals with no background in the sciences, but solely with an interest in learning more about nanotechnology. The evening was a wonderful way to start our new series intended to be a catalyst for networking, socializing and interacting with the general public.

## Nanochats: Microfabricated structures and soft materials for cardiac implants

Dr. Simon Dunham is an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering in Radiology at Weill Cornell Medical College. He discussed the development of microfabricated structures and soft materials for use in medical implants. Simon presented his lab's research on the way soft materials, especially those with microfabricated features can be utilized to create novel implants or enhance the functionality of traditional implants. The event was held at the CUNY Graduate Center in Midtown Manhattan and was co-sponsored with the CUNY Materials Research Society Chapter.
