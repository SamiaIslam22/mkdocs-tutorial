New state-of-the-art laboratories have been built for the CSMR. These include an optics & rheology lab, a biophysics lab, and a colloid synthesis lab. The space is designed to be flexible in order to facilitate rapid development of new experiments as well as collaborations between scientists at the Center.
#### MSK Center for Molecular Imaging & Nanotechnology
[S I T E](https://www.mskcc.org/research-programs/molecular-imaging-nanotechnology)
Memorial Sloan Kettering’s Center for Molecular Imaging and Nanotechnology (CMINT) is a broad-scope, multidisciplinary translational research program that unites two rapidly evolving fields — molecular imaging and nanotechnology — by creating strong teams of researchers working in diverse areas such as cancer biology, medicine, chemistry, developmental biology, physics, radiochemistry, immunology, genomics, pharmacology, and engineering. Our goal is to speed research into the biology of cancers and augment the development of innovative treatments — including molecularly based, image-guided therapies — as well as diagnostic and prognostic tools.
​
CMINT investigators take a highly pragmatic approach to addressing biologically and clinically relevant problems, with a range of diverse yet interrelated projects. We focus our translational research efforts on innovative ideas and applications that can be tested in preclinical models and eventually phase I clinical trials, and that we believe will ultimately transform routine cancer care.
#### Center for Precision Assembly of Superstratic and Superatomic Solids (Columbia MRSEC)
[S I T E](https://mrsec.columbia.edu/)
The PAS3 led by Columbia University in partnership with City College of New York, studies materials composed of atomically precise low-dimensional building blocks: two-dimensional atomic sheets and zero-dimensional molecular clusters. The interdisciplinary team comprises faculty from materials science, chemistry, physics, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. The research of the center is strengthened by collaborations with academic and industrial researchers, partnership with Brookhaven National Laboratory, and international partners. Support for the center is provided through the NSF Grant DMR-1420634, part of the NSF MRSEC Program. Additional support is provided by Columbia University.
This MRSEC, led by Columbia University in partnership with City College of New York, Harvard University, Barnard College, and the University of the Virgin Islands, encompasses two IRGs around the theme of building higher dimensional materials from lower dimensional structures with unprecedented levels of control. Both IRGs are built around techniques pioneered by the team, and bring together researchers with diverse capabilities, strong accomplishments, and a record of collaboration. The unified center will enable formation of the interdisciplinary teams required to undertake the proposed research, support of shared experimental tools, implementation of a multi-faceted program of education and human resources development, and focused efforts to improve diversity. The MRSEC leverages the proximity of Columbia, CCNY, and Barnard for intercampus cooperation, and nearby K-12 schools for educational activities. Brookhaven National Laboratory, IBM, DuPont, and other partners provide research partnerships and educational opportunities. Synergy among the two IRG teams includes the common emphasis on materials assembly with precise control, and is enhanced by co-advising of MRSEC Fellows and common educational activities.
#### CREST Center for Interface Design & Engineered Assembly of Low Dimensional Systems
[S I T E](https://idealscrest.org/)
The CREST Center for Interface Design and Engineered Assembly of Low Dimensional Systems (IDEALS) addresses the national need for "accelerating the pace of discovery and deployment of advanced material systems" as stated in the Materials Genome Initiative. A diverse multidisciplinary team of researchers with complementary interests has come together to design and discover materials with new and enhanced functionalities that culminate from the control of the salient unique properties of surfaces, interfaces and defects in self-assembled nanomaterials; and to further technology, energy and health applications.

#### MSK-Cornell Center for Translation of Cancer Nanomedicine
[S I T E](https://www.mskcc.org/research-programs/translation-cancer-nanomedicine)
Novel diagnostic and therapeutic nanotechnologies that can enable earlier and more specific detection of cancer, as well as enhance treatment response, are critically needed to improve patient outcomes. For instance, these tools may allow the operating surgeon to directly visualize tumor margins and/or metastatic disease spread to nearby lymph nodes. At the same time, vital normal tissue structures can be avoided if labeled with suitable agents.
​
The goal of the MSK-Cornell Center for Translation of Cancer Nanomedicine (MC2TCN) is to advance, translate, and disseminate a suite of ultrasmall (<10 nm), multimodality (PET/optical), core-shell silica nanoparticles. In addition to fluorescent particles being highly versatile and exquisitely bright, their size, brightness, and geometry can be tuned for a variety of cancer-care applications. Earlier-generation particles, referred to as Cornell dots or C dots, have already received FDA investigational new drug approvals for phase 1 clinical trials in melanoma, breast cancer, uterine/cervical cancer, and brain tumor patients. 
#### NYU Materials Research Science and Engineering Center
