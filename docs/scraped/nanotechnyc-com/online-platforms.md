#### Nanohub
[S I T E ](https://nanohub.org/)
Supported by the National Science Foundation, NCN provides an infrastructure and research network for computational nanoscience. Extensive resources in support of research and education are delivered through its portal at [nanohub.org](http://www.nanohub.org/). nanoHUB.org is the premier place for computational nanotechnology research, education, and collaboration. The site hosts a rapidly growing collection of Simulation Programs for nanoscale phenomena that run in the cloud and are accessible through a web browser.
#### National Nanomanufacturing Network (NNN)
[S I T E ](http://www.internano.org/)
The mission of the [NNN](http://www.internano.org/content/view/66/227/) (supported by the NSF) is to serve as a catalyst for progress in nanomanufacturing in the U.S., through the facilitation and promotion of nanomanufacturing workshops, road mapping, inter-institutional collaborations, technology transition, test beds, and information exchange services. The NNN operates as an open-access network of centers, leaders, experts, and stakeholders from the nanomanufacturing research, development, and education community. It is a partnership between academia, industry and government that is built to foster and serve nanomanufacturing communities of practice. Information on nanomanufacturing processes is distributed through its [interNano website](http://www.internano.org/).
#### National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI)
[S I T E ](https://www.nnci.net/)
To help alleviate the lack of these resources in both smaller academic institutions, as well as in the small to medium size commercial sector, the National Science Foundation has supported a network of user facilities for the past forty years, under various names. The NNCI was established in 2015, is the latest version of this national resource. Research undertaken within NNCI facilities is incredibly broad, with applications in electronics, materials, biomedicine, energy, geosciences, environmental sciences, consumer products, and many more.
#### National Nanotechnology Initiative ([NNI](http://www.nano.gov/))
[S I T E ](https://www.nano.gov/)
The NNI is a U.S. Government research and development (R&D) initiative involving the nanotechnology-related activities of 20 departments and independent agencies. The NNI today consists of the individual and cooperative nanotechnology-related activities of Federal agencies with a range of research and regulatory roles and responsibilities. Funding support for nanotechnology R&D stems directly from NNI member agencies, not the NNI.
#### MEMSnet
[S I T E ](http://www.memsnet.org/news/)
MEMSnet is a MEMS ClearinghouseÂ® and information portal for the MEMS and Nanotechnology community hosted by the MEMS and Nanotechnology Exchange (MNX). MEMSnet provides material databases, resume listings, news and MEMS-talk (MEMS discussion listserv). 
#### AZo Nano
[S I T E ](https://www.azonano.com/)
AZoNano educates and informs a worldwide audience of researchers, engineers and scientists in the Nanotechnology industry. The site is a useful source for nanotech news, articles, editorials discussing recent industry developments, interviews with key opinion leaders and industry professionals and product profiles. 
#### Nanowerk
[S I T E ](https://www.nanowerk.com/)
Nanowerk is a website dedicated to providing education and information on nanosciences, nanotechnologies and other emerging technologies. It delivers useful, entertaining and cutting-edge information from all things nano. Nanowerk has become one of the premier nanotechnology portals with depth and relevant scope, unique editorial content and comprehensive resources.
#### Nanotechnology Now
[S I T E ](http://www.nanotech-now.com/)
A website providing nanotechnology basics, news, and general information. Additionally, the site offers consulting, technology monitoring, and in-depth analysis, as well as up-to-the-minute news briefs and breaking developments in the nanosciences.
