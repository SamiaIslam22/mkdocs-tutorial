##### Nanotechnology in NYC

Over the past decade, New York City has seen dramatic increases in private and public nanotech investments. While not known as a hub for nanotechnology, NYC finds itself quickly gaining on traditional hot spots such as Boston and Silicon Valley. With several NYC institutions growing their nanotech faculty and resources, the city is now producing a new crop of scientists and engineers, enabling the creation of a new nanotech start-up community.

##### Building a Nanotech Community

We hope to be a source of information for anyone interested in nanotechnology. Specifically, we aim to give students information on the many educational opportunities in the city, give researchers a place to discover potential collaborators, provide a comprehensive list of resources for anyone who is in need of specialized instrumentation or services, and be a one-stop-shop for those looking for talks, conferences, symposiums and other relevant events going on in the area.
